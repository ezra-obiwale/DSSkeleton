dsSkeleton
===============

A skeletal application of dScribe Framework from which more complex applications can be developed.


SETUP
======

1. Install dsSkeleton to your server.
2. Open the directory in your terminal and run the following commands to install required files.
    ````
    composer.phar self-update
    composer.phar install
    ````
    
    *Note*: If you already have composer installed globally, just run 
    ````
    composer install
    ````
3. Change the permission for the dsSkeleton/public directory to 0777 (e.g. chmod 0777 PATH/TO/dsSkeleton/public).

That's all.

You can now open dsSkeleton from your browser.

Cheers.
